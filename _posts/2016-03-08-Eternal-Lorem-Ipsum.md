As I told in the presentation post, when I started to use R I founded that in each project I did, I had problems developing it and I needed to search solutions to these problems. For this reason I decided to create a blog. To have a site to put all the problems I founded and the steps I followed to solve them. So, I thought that it would be appropiated tell how my first expirience creating a blog was.

My fisrt attempt was creating a blog in Wordpress. So, I started to search a package in R that allows posting in WordPress. Searching, I founded [the blog of Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/wordpress/). There, he tells that you have an alternative for blogging: Jekyll. The key was:

> ...and that is why you, as a cool hacker, should blog with Jekyll instead of WordPress.

And I wanted to be *a cool hacker*.

## Creating a blog using jekyll.

**Jekyll** is a static site generator.

As they tell in their [site](http://jekyllrb.com/):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and our [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.
